# Authenticity Assessment

Evaluate whether choices, beliefs, or actions reflect genuine self-ownership (Eigentlichkeit) or absorption into das Man's anonymous conformity.

---

## When to Use

- Questioning whether a decision is truly yours or merely "what one does"
- Sensing that you are going through the motions without genuine commitment
- Examining beliefs you have never actually chosen
- Feeling disconnected from your own life choices
- Wanting to distinguish authentic voice from internalized "They"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The decision, belief, action, or life pattern to examine |
| context | No | Background on how this situation arose |
| current_feelings | No | Sense of disconnection, doubt, or certainty |

## Workflow
### Step 1: What Authenticity Is

For Heidegger, authenticity (Eigentlichkeit) does not mean:
- Discovering a "true inner self"
- Being original or unique
- Rejecting all social influence
- Radical individualism

Authenticity means **owning** your existence—taking up your thrown possibilities as *yours* rather than merely drifting with what "one" does.

The German *eigentlich* suggests what is "one's own" (eigen). The authentic person has "achieved" or "chosen" themselves—not discovered a pre-existing essence, but taken responsibility for their being.

### Step 2: What Inauthenticity Is

Inauthenticity (Uneigentlichkeit) is not a moral failing. It is the default mode of Dasein—our everyday being, where:
- Das Man (the "They") provides ready-made interpretations
- We do what "one" does without question
- We hold beliefs because "one" believes them
- Decisions have already been made for us by public opinion

Inauthenticity provides **tranquility**—the comfortable sense that all is well, that we know what to do, that difficult questions have been settled.

### Step 3: The Anxiety That Discloses

What reveals the difference? **Anxiety** (Angst)—not fear of something specific, but the uncanny groundlessness when the They's interpretations suddenly fail to hold.

In anxiety, das Man's answers stop working. The borrowed meaning collapses. And in that collapse, the possibility of authentic choosing opens.

## The Three-Step Assessment

### Step 1: Trace the Origin

Ask: Where did this choice, belief, or pattern *come from*?

Questions to probe:
- When did I first adopt this? Was there a moment of genuine choice?
- Who or what prescribed this as the right thing to do/believe?
- If I say "one should..." or "you have to..." or "everyone knows..."—whose voice is speaking?
- What would das Man say about someone who chose differently?

**Markers of They-absorption:**
- The answer came pre-formed before you questioned it
- Deviation would be seen as strange, irresponsible, or foolish
- You cannot remember choosing—it just "happened"
- Justification appeals to what "people" think or do

### Step 2: Apply the Ownership Test

Ask: Can I own this as *mine*—not as what circumstances forced, not as what "one" does, but as my genuine thrown projection?

Distinguish:
- **Authentic ownership:** "This is what I choose, knowing I could choose otherwise, taking responsibility for the consequences"
- **Resigned acceptance:** "I have to—there's no other option"
- **They-conformity:** "This is what you do in my situation"

The test: Could you stand before your ownmost possibility (death) and affirm this choice? Not "this was reasonable" or "this is what made sense"—but "this was *mine*."

### Step 3: Identify What Authentic Choosing Would Require

If the assessment reveals They-absorption, ask:
- What would it mean to genuinely choose in this situation?
- What anxiety would I have to face to own this?
- What does das Man protect me from by providing ready answers?
- What possibility opens if I stop fleeing into the They?

## Outputs
```markdown
## Authenticity Assessment

### The Situation
[Restatement of what is being examined]

### Step 1: Origin Trace
- **Source of this pattern:** [How did this arise?]
- **The They's prescription:** [What does das Man say about this?]
- **Evidence of absorption:** [Markers of They-dictated choice]
- **Moment of genuine choice:** [Was there one? Can you identify it?]

### Step 2: Ownership Test
**Can this be owned as yours?**
- [ ] Authentic ownership - genuinely chosen, responsibility taken
- [ ] Resigned acceptance - felt forced by circumstances
- [ ] They-conformity - prescribed by das Man

**Evidence:** [Specific indicators supporting the assessment]

### Step 3: The Authentic Possibility
- **What das Man protects you from:** [The anxiety being avoided]
- **What authentic choosing would require:** [The confrontation needed]
- **The possibility that opens:** [What becomes available if you stop fleeing]

### Assessment Summary
**Authentic / Inauthentic / Mixed**

[Summary of what the assessment reveals and what it would mean to take up this situation authentically]

## Constraints

- Do not equate inauthenticity with moral failure—it is a structural mode of Dasein
- Do not pretend authenticity means escaping all social influence
- Acknowledge that complete authenticity is not a stable achievement but a possibility
- Be specific about what das Man prescribes in this particular case
- Respect the difficulty—fleeing from authenticity is not weakness but the human condition

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "I'm pursuing a law degree because it's a 'respectable career' and my parents are proud, but I hate every minute of it. Is this authentic?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Authenticity Assessment

### The Situation
Pursuing a law degree experienced as externally imposed rather than genuinely chosen.

### Step 1: Origin Trace

- **Source of this pattern:** The choice was shaped by parental expectation and cultural scripts about "respectable careers." The decision preceded genuine questioning of whether this path was wanted.

- **The They's prescription:** Das Man says: "Law is a good career. You should make your parents proud. Giving up now would be throwing away your future. One does not walk away from a respectable path."

- **Evidence of absorption:** The phrase "respectable career" is pure They-talk—respectability is what das Man values. The concern with parental pride suggests others' interpretations are structuring the choice. "Hating every minute" indicates the absence of authentic commitment.

- **Moment of genuine choice:** None identifiable. The law degree appears to have been adopted as what "one" does when smart and ambitious, never genuinely questioned until the hatred became undeniable.

### Step 2: Ownership Test

**Can this be owned as yours?**
- [ ] Authentic ownership
- [ ] Resigned acceptance
- [x] They-conformity

**Evidence:** The justifications offered are entirely das Man's justifications—respectability, parental pride, external validation. The subjective experience (hatred) is completely disconnected from the choice. This is not a case of doing something difficult that serves one's genuine project—it is doing what "one" does while the self that would genuinely choose has been suppressed.

### Step 3: The Authentic Possibility

- **What das Man protects you from:** The anxiety of taking responsibility for your own life path. The terrifying freedom of asking "What do *I* want?" without the shelter of others' approval. The possibility of being seen as irresponsible or disappointing.

- **What authentic choosing would require:** Standing in the anxiety rather than fleeing. Owning that you are thrown into a situation with genuine alternatives. Taking responsibility not for what "makes sense" but for what is *yours*. Accepting that authentic choice may disappoint those whose interpretations you have borrowed.

- **The possibility that opens:** The question of what you would genuinely project toward. Not "what is respectable?" but "what would I own as mine, standing before my finitude?" This question has been closed by das Man. Authentic choosing would open it.

### Assessment Summary
**Inauthentic**

This situation shows classic They-absorption: a life-shaping choice made according to das Man's prescriptions without genuine self-ownership. The hatred signals the suppressed self. Authentic engagement would require facing the anxiety of choosing for yourself—which das Man's ready interpretations precisely protect you from.

The question is not "Should I quit law school?" That would be replacing one They-prescribed answer with another. The question is: "What happens when I stop fleeing from the question of my own being, and let what is genuinely mine show itself?"
